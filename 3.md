Since the beginning of the 21 st century, China 's high-speed railway has experienced leapfrog development and is at the forefront of the world. The demand for high-speed rail parts to machine tools is facing more and more diversity, and higher standards are put forward for machine tool products in terms of accuracy and efficiency [ 1 ]. Among them, efficient special machine tools are the key points to improve the production and quality of high-speed trains. Therefore, it is very important to study the characteristics of high-speed rail for high-speed rail processing machine tools.   

Firstly, this paper classifies the high-speed rail machining parts and determines the selection of high-speed rail machine tools. Then, it focuses on the types of special machine tools for the application of high-speed rail mechanical machining parts. Finally, it summarizes and discusses the development trend of machine tools in the field of high-speed rail, and provides some reference for the study of high-speed rail machine tools.

1 Classification of high-speed rail machinable parts and selection of high-speed rail machine tools
High-speed rail machining parts classification
The application of machine tools in high-speed rail can not only improve the processing efficiency, accuracy and quality of parts [ 2 ], but also save manpower and financial resources. The classification of high-speed rail parts facilitates the analysis of the workpiece processing process and the machine tools applied.

The research on the classification of high-speed rail parts began in 2011, mainly based on the classification of high-speed rail information, including hierarchical classification, surface classification and mixed classification.The hierarchical classification method is a classification system that arranges classification objects into a hierarchical expansion, suitable for classification with clear hierarchy, strong logic, and a large amount of information. The face classification method is to classify the selected classification objects according to their features, which is suitable for classification with complex rules, no commonalities, and a small amount of encoded data. The hybrid classification method is a combination of hierarchical classification and surface classification, suitable for classification with large classification volume and no commonality. Due to the complex structure and numerous components of high-speed rail, as well as the strict membership relationship between systems, components, and parts, adopting the hierarchical classification method is the best solution [3]. Divide the high-speed rail system into systems and subsystems according to its structure, and then disassemble them one by one to the smallest possible processing units. The classification system is shown in Figure 1, and the summarized classification of high-speed rail machinable components is shown in Table 1.

Table 1 High-speed rail machinable system and parts classification table



It can be seen from Table 1 that the parts of track, bogie, car body and catenary are mainly mechanical machinable parts, while the parts of air supply and braking device and high voltage traction system are mainly non-mechanical machinable parts.

High-speed rail machine tool selection
The key to the stable operation of high-speed rail is to ensure the cooperation between various parts, which is inseparable from the parts manufacturing machine tools. Therefore, the selection of high-speed rail machine tools is extremely important. The demand of high-speed railway for machine tools is divided into four aspects :

( 1 ) Rail and ballastless plate manufacturing in track system.

( 2 ) Frame, wheel set and other manufacturing in the bogie system.

( 3 ) Manufacture of locomotive body.

( 4 ) Daily maintenance and repair of high-speed rail operation.

Because these processing belongs to mechanical manufacturing, the demand for general machine tools and special machine tools is large, so the selection of machine tools is based on the production type of enterprises, the complexity of products and other factors to consider :

( 1 ) The selection of general machine tools. Due to the wide variety of machine tools, and each machine tool should meet the corresponding scope of application and processing conditions in order to meet the requirements. Therefore, in the selection, the typical processing parts are determined by analyzing the processing procedures, and the appropriate machine tools are selected within a certain range. At the same time, the development of the machine tool process should be properly considered to leave room for development. Then, the parts are classified and grouped according to the similarity principle. Finally, the machine tool suitable for workpiece processing is determined [ 4 ].

( 2 ) Selection of special machine tools. Because the special machine tool is a kind of machine tool which is specially suitable for the processing of a specific part or a specific process [ 5 ], and it is usually indispensable in the automatic production line manufacturing system. Therefore, when selecting the machine tool, we first select the machine tool according to the customer 's product requirements, and analyze the processing technology to select the machine tool within a certain range. Then, the processing effect should be considered, and the optimal choice should be combined with economy under the same conditions. Finally, the better processing machine tool is determined.

2 Application status of machine tools for machinable parts of high-speed railway machinery
There are various types of machine tools applied to high-speed rail parts processing. This section will classify the machine tools used in the key mechanical machinable parts of high-speed rail according to the summary of Section 1.1, focusing on mainstream products.

2.1 Rail system processing machine
The track system is the guiding part of the operation of high-speed rail vehicles, and it is a complex overall engineering structure.

2.1.1 Rail processing machine
The rail is the track part that supports and guides the train operation, which is in the shape of " 工. " The processing procedures include derusting, welding, weld normalizing and air cooling, rough grinding, straightening, fine grinding and welding ultrasonic inspection [ 6 ]. The seamless rail laid on the high-speed rail track produces a weld every time it is welded, which requires high-precision machine tools to accurately grind and process the welded parts. In addition, the turnout is one of the weak links of the track. It is a line connecting device that transfers the vehicle from one track to another. The types are diverse, as shown in Figure 2, and its processing is extremely important.

At present, domestic rail welding joints are finished by fine grinding machine and fine milling machine. The precision grinding machine is a tool machine that uses a grinding tool to grind the workpiece to obtain the required shape, size and precision machining surface. Finish milling machine refers to the tool machine that the milling cutter processes a variety of surfaces of the workpiece to obtain the required processing shape and precision. For the precision shaping treatment of welds, the traditional process at home and abroad is mainly grinding. Due to the shortcomings of the fine grinding machine in the process of processing, such as insufficient weld grinding, increased local temperature of grinding, long processing time, low production efficiency, serious grinding dust pollution and inability to accurately locate, in the early stage, the fine grinding machine was mainly introduced in China, and in the later stage, the fine milling machine was mainly developed in China.
