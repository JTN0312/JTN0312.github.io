FAQ
What is the difference between turning and milling?
Turning is the process of removing material from a workpiece by rotating it against a cutting tool. Milling, on the other hand, involves using a rotating cutting tool to remove material from a stationary workpiece.

In turning, the cutting tool is stationary and the workpiece rotates, while in milling, the cutting tool rotates and the workpiece is stationary. Turning is typically used to create cylindrical shapes, while milling is better suited for creating complex shapes and features 

Additionally, both processes can be used to create precision parts with high accuracy and tight tolerances, which is critical in the medical field to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and implants.

Which machining process is best for creating complex shapes?
Milling is the most common machining process because it is highly versatile and capable of creating complex shapes and features. It works by removing material from a workpiece using a rotary cutter. This allows for precise and intricate cuts that cannot be achieved through other machining processes.

In the aerospace field, milling is particularly useful for creating critical components such as turbine blades and engine parts. These components require high precision and accuracy, and milling is capable of meeting those demands. Additionally, milling allows for the creation of lightweight parts, which is important in aerospace applications where weight is a critical factor.

What is the future development of mechanical processing?

The future development of mechanical processing is likely to involve increased automation and the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. This will allow for faster and more efficient machining processes, as well as the ability to produce more complex shapes and features with greater precision and accuracy.

Additionally, there is a growing focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing processes. This has led to the development of new machining techniques and technologies that are more energy-efficient and produce less waste.

Overall, the future of mechanical processing is bright, with continued innovation and advancements in technology driving the industry forward.
