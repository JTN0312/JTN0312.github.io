1 Introduction
In the field of aerospace, automotive and biomedical manufacturing, a key issue that people have been concerned about is reliability. People need to understand that the performance of the processed parts has the greatest safety and predictability. The performance of a component is largely affected by the quality and reliability of its surface morphology, that is to say, the quality and performance of the product is directly related to its surface integrity. Surface integrity includes mechanical properties ( residual stress, hardness, etc. ), metallurgical state ( phase transformation, microstructure and related performance changes, etc. ) and surface parameters ( surface finish and surface morphology characteristics ) of the workpiece during processing. In the aerospace industry, surface integrity is one of the most relevant parameters to evaluate the quality of machined surface when machining key structural components for high reliability. In particular, titanium alloys and nickel-based alloys will generate residual stress during processing, which has received extensive attention due to its impact on the safety and sustainability of parts.

In the past few decades, many researchers have been trying to study the relationship between processing parameters and their effects on surface quality and product performance.The driving force behind this is the growing demand for component performance, reliability, and durability, which promotes the development of materials, enhances their resistance to harsh bearing conditions and environments, and develops high-performance manufacturing methods. For example, additive manufacturing technology, which has rapidly developed in the past decade, has the ability to quickly develop products and directly produce metal parts with complex geometric shapes, while significantly improving material utilization and reducing costs. However, there is still a certain gap between additive manufacturing parts and forgings in terms of critical performance such as fatigue. Therefore, people are actively exploring effective post-processing methods, such as using laser shot peening to strengthen additive manufacturing of TC4 titanium alloy, studying the improvement effect of additive manufacturing TC4 titanium alloy surface integrity, and comparing the strengthening effect with conventional forged titanium alloy of the same brand. The results indicate that laser shot peening has little effect on the surface roughness of the two materials, and the residual compressive stress introduced by laser shot peening on the TC4 surface of additive manufacturing is lower than that introduced by conventional forging TC4 surface.

In addition, a large number of literature has reported research on the related issues of nickel based alloy machining, such as rapid tool wear and adverse changes in the machined surface, as well as the hardening layer caused by machining. The low thermal conductivity of nickel based alloys leads to an increase in the temperature of the cutting edge of the tool, which in turn causes adhesion between the workpiece material and the cutting edge. In addition, hard particles (such as carbides) in the alloy will accelerate tool wear. The local high temperature, temperature gradient, and high pressure stress caused by machining will change the microstructure, resulting in white layer/surface damage in the deep direction of the material, which will have adverse effects on the performance of the parts. Griffith conducted a comprehensive analysis of surface integrity parameters and their control on enhancing fatigue life.

2 Surface integrity
Titanium alloy is a kind of material with high specific strength and specific stiffness, good high temperature mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and creep properties. Therefore, titanium alloy is suitable for manufacturing various fuselage and engine components ( fan blades, compressor blades and disks, stator blades, inlet and outlet guide vanes, etc. ). Titanium alloy is a typical difficult-to-machine material due to its low thermal conductivity, high tensile strength and good chemical activity at high temperature. Nickel-based alloy is another important material for aero-engines. Its main advantage is heat resistance, and it still maintains high mechanical and chemical properties at high temperatures. It has high melting point temperature, good corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Fatigue, thermal shock, creep and erosion properties. The major challenge is also the low thermal conductivity of nickel-based thermal resistance alloys, which increases the heat impact during processing, often exhibits work hardening behavior, and the tool surface has high adhesion characteristics. Therefore, many scholars and researchers have done a lot of research on the microstructure, mechanical properties, cutting performance and application of titanium alloy and nickel-based alloy. Zhang Xiangqin et al.found that the tangential force and cutting depth resistance increased with the increase of feed rate, and obtained serrated chips which were in good agreement with the experimental results by finite element simulation. They believed that serrated chips were generated by adiabatic shear bands [ 3 ]. Yang Shucai studied the influence of tool edge on cutting TC4 through experiment and finite element method, and established the cutting force model under blunt edge [ 4 ]. Chen Ming et al.studied the influence of cutting parameters on cutting force and cutting temperature, and obtained the tool wear mechanism when drilling 3D printed titanium alloy through experiments [ 5 ]. The surface integrity, residual stress and machinability of nickel-based alloys have also been extensively studied [ 6-7 ]. For example, the surface damage of nickel-based alloy during turning, the finite element analysis of white layer formation, and the experimental observation of white layer formation. At the same time, scholars have also studied the microstructure and yield strength of the material, as well as the residual stress, hardness distribution and surface roughness of the material during the milling process [ 8-9 ], as well as the thermal response and mechanical response of surface damage to the cutting process.

The surface integrity of parts plays a vital role in the machining process. In most applications, the surface is required to be as smooth as possible, especially for the fatigue life of the machined part, and the surface integrity of the part is important. [ 10 ] The characteristics of various integrity attributes that affect the surface integrity of parts introduced or processed by the machining process can be divided into :

( a ) morphological characteristics, such as texture, waviness and surface roughness ;

( b ) Affected mechanical properties, such as residual stress and hardness ;

( c ) Metallurgical state, such as microstructure, phase transformation, grain size and shape, inclusions, etc. The surface properties of these changes can be divided into five categories : mechanical properties, thermal properties, metallurgical properties, chemical properties and electrical properties. In a word, scholars have done a lot of research on the surface integrity of machined parts, and have carried out extensive review on this kind of research [ 11-12 ]. This paper only introduces titanium and nickel-based alloys and different tool materials, and summarizes various surface integrity problems under the influence of different cutting parameters.

2.1 Surface defects
Parts of surface defects have various forms, as shown in figure 1 figure 3, its main form is surface resistance, material pull / cracking, feed trace, sticky material particles, tear surface, debris, surface pull, deformation particles, surface cavity, slip area 'wealth' seven according to reports, when the heat of material softening degree increases, compression stress also added. The defects of the processed surface also disappear, allowing the work piece close to the surface. These types of defects were observed by the researchers in many different shackles and titanium alloys, such as NiCr20TiA groaning, IN 718, titanium based Ti-6242S ", and Ti44 ®

The cutting parameters have a certain influence on these surface defects. The feed trace is obvious in the processing, but its severity can be adjusted by changing and optimizing the feed rate. Cutting speed affects the number of surface micro-debris, while cutting depth and other parameters affect the tearing, resistance and coating of the material. [ 16 ] Many surface defects will be found in the processing of nickel and titanium alloys, especially in the processing of micron precision, so it is very important to optimize the cutting conditions. The largest defects in the surface defects are the cutting marks, the re-deposition of the chips to the surface and the grain deformation. In addition, pulling particles from the surface and redepositing them on the surface will produce two different defects, and these particles will also cause drag and tear defects when passing through the surface next time. It is very difficult to adjust the cutting parameters according to these defects, and it is difficult to completely eliminate surface defects.

In addition, the structure of some parts materials contains carbide particles, and many coating materials also contain some carbides. When the tool wears and the part is machined, these carbide particles are sometimes removed from the machined surface or the tool and stuck to the surface of the part. [ 15 ] This phenomenon is called carbide crack ( Fig.2 ), which leads to a sudden increase in shear stress during the cutting process, resulting in voids and cracks on the surface due to drawing, and even more serious surface problems. Both titanium alloy and nickel-based alloy are prone to carbide cracks, and the existence of cracks greatly reduces the fatigue life of the material. Therefore, the surface integrity of carbide cracks at the microscopic scale may be a serious problem. Especially when the cutting depth and feed rate are very small, the carbide particles are close to a certain scale, and the carbide cracks may be extremely important on the surface of the final product.

2.2 Surface structure changes
During the processing of parts, the material is exposed to thermal energy, mechanical energy and chemical energy, which leads to strain aging and recrystallization of the material, so that the material may become harder but less ductile. These thermal ( high temperature, rapid quenching ) and mechanical ( high stress, strain ) effects are the main reasons for the change of microstructure, phase transformation and plastic deformation of materials.

The study of Ti-64 and Ti-6246S shows that a very thin layer of plastic deformation is formed on the subsurface of the workpiece. With the wear of the tool, due to the change of the microstructure, the plastic deformation and the thickness of the subsequent deformation layer increase [ 20 ]. When the cutting speed and feed rate increase, the depth of microstructural changes under these surfaces is observed to increase [ 16 ]. In addition, long-term use of worn tool processing will also increase the microstructure changes of the material, manifested as severe plastic deformation and a thicker ' interference ' layer on the machined surface. [ 21 ] Fig.3 shows that the grain boundary deformation in the machining direction is related to the increase of feed rate or tool wear. Fig.4 shows the microstructural changes of Ti-6242S alloy before and after milling ( V = 100 m / min, f = 0.15 mm / tooth, Do C = 2 mm ) [ 16 ]. When these microstructures are dominant in strain aging, white layers are formed and recrystallization is also observed.Under an optical microscope, another darker image can be observed, with a hardness value between the white layer and the matrix material, which has been widely studied in steel materials.

2.3 Surface plastic deformation
The main problem of surface integrity comes from the plastic deformation of the workpiece during the machining process. It is necessary to study the influencing factors of these deformations. These deformations are caused by many parameters such as cutting parameters ( cutting speed, feed rate, cutting depth ), tool parameters ( rake angle, blade radius, shape, coating, wear ) and workpiece parameters ( material, structure ). In order to find out the main reason for the plastic deformation of the workpiece, a lot of research has been carried out. Studies have shown that during the processing of titanium alloys Ti-64 and Ti-6246, as the tool wears, the plastic deformation of the workpiece increases, forming a white layer [ 17,21 ]. In addition, the nickel-based alloy IN-718 was processed with processing parameters V = 32 ~ 56 m / min, f = 0.13 ~ 0.25 mm / rev, and Do C = 1 ~ 2 mm. After 1 min, it was observed that although there was no obvious plastic deformation, the subsurface of the material showed severe plastic deformation when the processing time was extended by 15 min [ 23 ] ( Fig.5 ). This is due to the in
