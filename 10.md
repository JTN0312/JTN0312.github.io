1 Introduction
At present, in the development process of the automobile industry, a lot of mechanical equipment needs to be used in production and manufacturing. With the increasing number of various mechanical equipment, higher standards and requirements are put forward for the production accuracy of the whole mechanical parts. Machinery and equipment need to be composed of different parts, need to ensure the quality of various parts and equipment, in order to achieve the precision requirements of automobile parts processing. However, at present, in the actual automobile parts processing and production process, there will be many external factors affecting the processing accuracy of automobile parts. In addition to affecting the overall production quality and production efficiency of the enterprise, it will also lead to different degrees of errors in the parameters and standard requirements of automobile parts. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to analyze the influence of machining process on the accuracy of automobile parts.



2 The influence of geometric error on the accuracy of parts
The mechanical processing technology system is usually based on the set programming program to carry out the corresponding processing and production of automobile parts. However, in the actual production and processing process, the machining accuracy of automobile parts is often affected by the accuracy of the spindle and tool of the machine tool. First of all, in the actual production and processing process, the most important role of the spindle of the machine tool is to transmit. The actual rotation of the spindle will have a direct impact on the flatness of the machined surface of the workpiece. The spindle often has the phenomenon of rotation error in the actual machining process, that is to say, the spindle will deviate from the standard central axis in the rotation axis of different time periods, and the resulting deviation error will directly affect the accuracy of the auto parts. The important factors for the rotation error of the spindle include the different degrees of wear of the spindle during the long-term working process, the low matching degree of the bearing, and the low coaxial of the spindle. In order to further prevent the probability of rotation error of the spindle in the machining process, the relevant staff is required to assemble the spindle in strict accordance with the instructions and the specific standards of installation.The corresponding lubrication and maintenance of the spindle are carried out regularly to reduce the probability of spindle rotation error and avoid its direct impact on the machining accuracy of auto parts. Secondly, it is the influence of tool accuracy on the machining accuracy of automobile parts. The accuracy of the tool will directly affect the machining accuracy of automobile parts, especially in some special machining modes of automobile parts. The accuracy of the tool will play a decisive role in the machining accuracy of automobile parts. In the process of cutting, the corresponding friction will be formed between the cutting edge, the tool surface and the machined parts. Long time will lead to different degrees of wear of the tool. When the tool wears to a certain extent, the surface roughness of the automobile parts will gradually increase. At the same time, the cutting color and cutting shape of the parts will also change accordingly, forming a phenomenon of vibration. Tool wear also directly affects the production efficiency and production accuracy of cutting parts. In order to further improve the installation accuracy and final forming accuracy of the tool, wear-resistant tool materials can be used, and cooling lubricants can be used scientifically and reasonably to reduce the tool in the process of automobile parts. The wear caused by the process further extends the time period in which the tool can be used.



3 The influence of heating and force on the accuracy of parts
At present, China's mechanical processing industry is becoming a key component of the national industrial field, The process of machinery in the processing process is closely related to the accuracy of auto parts. Therefore, Mechanical equipment parts will directly affect the processing quality of auto parts and the service life of the current mechanical equipment, Individual auto parts themselves in the processing process of raw materials have quality problems, For example, in the processing of raw parts and materials, Due to the influence of large external forces or external high temperature, The impact of different degrees of deformation of raw materials and crack'force and heat on the accuracy of auto parts is mainly reflected in: the tool friction processing process, The cutter will cut the auto parts, In the process of cutting, The tool and the parts rub together and create a lot of heat, Under the influence of the high temperature, In the process of auto parts processing process, Need for a scientific and reasonable selection of cutting tools, And the relevant staff needs to pay attention to the degree of cutting, And through the corresponding cooling measures to further control the thermal deformation phenomenon of the tool, Further improve the processing accuracy of auto parts. During the processing of the spare parts, Auto parts can be themselves due by the heat generated by the tool, If there is a thermal deformation, Will directly affect the processing accuracy of the current auto parts, e.g, During the surface processing of the hammer head on the planer, The machining surface of the parts will rapidly increase the cutting temperature in a short time due to the extrusion of the blade knife, At the same time, when the surface temperature of the processing parts decreases, The work-piece will produce an uneven heating condition, Gradually produces a thermal deformation, It eventually appears to protruding on the upper surface, Lead to a gradually increasing cutting volume, Affect the whole, the accuracy of the processing workpiece.



4 The influence of machining operation on the accuracy of spare parts
Adjustment and clamping, In the process of machining of auto parts, Due to the gradual advancement of processing process, Multiple adjustments and clamping of auto parts, However, in the process of adjustment and clamping processing, Since the manual operation of the staff cannot ensure the accuracy of the adjustment, Unable to guarantee the standard relative position between the tool and the workpiece during the clamping adjustment, As long as small errors occur, Will lead to a corresponding shift in the amount of auto parts processed, The error in auto parts gradually gradually: therefore, In the process of machining of auto parts, Relevant operators to carry out scientific and reasonable standardized operations, Reduce the accuracy error due to adjustment and clamping, For many mass-produced auto parts processing processes, Can use the fixed fixture or the selection of reasonable auxiliary tools to adjust and clip processing, Reduce the accuracy error of auto parts caused by the clamping.
Measurement error, measurement is based in the process of auto parts processing workflow, to ensure that the size of the auto parts remain within the scientific and reasonable range and can adjust the corresponding processing, the precision of the car parts, parts processing accuracy, if used in the process of measurement, not ideal or the measuring tool is not correct, can lead to car zero, parts production error, in order to reduce the measurement error, need related measuring personnel standardized operation, to ensure that the use of scientific and reasonable.
5 How to improve the processing level of mechanical parts and components
5.1 Improve the machining system and equipment
