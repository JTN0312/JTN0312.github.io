High-end laser manufacturing equipment that is not subject to humans will be the core competitiveness of titanium alloy aviation structural parts processing.

1 Challenges and development trend of military structural parts manufacturing
Structural requirements and material development of each generation of military aircraft
A generation of military aircraft, a generation of materials [1]. The first generation aircraft mainly met the requirements of high subsonic flight, emphasizing the yield strength, tensile strength, plasticity, and impact toughness of structural components, mainly using steel frames and wooden materials; The second generation aircraft mainly meets the needs of high-altitude, high-speed, and close range combat, emphasizing the fatigue performance of key parts, and extensively uses aluminum alloys and steel; The third generation aircraft mainly meets the requirements of high subsonic maneuverability. The materials in key parts are required to have high Damage tolerance performance, low crack growth rate and fracture toughness. A large number of lightweight high-performance materials are required to be applied. On the basis of aluminum alloy and steel, the use of titanium alloy and composite materials is increased; The fourth generation aircraft mainly emphasizes stealth performance and long life cycle, emphasizing the durability design of the aircraft. The main materials are similar to the third generation aircraft, but titanium alloy and composite materials account for a larger proportion; The fifth generation aircraft needs to possess the characteristics of high intelligence, high collaboration, and high-speed flight, with higher requirements for structural strength, as well as the application of a large number of thermal protection materials and high-temperature resistant alloys.

Challenges faced by military structural parts manufacturing
Weight loss and longevity increase
The body structure is one of the key factors that determine the performance index of military aircraft. For half a century, the structure technology has been developing, and the structure form has tended to be ' classic ' [ 2 ]. As shown in Table 1, the percentage of the structural weight of the airframe of each generation of foreign fighters to the total weight of the whole aircraft is decreasing, and the demand for fatigue life of the airframe is increasing. However, compared with the ideal structural weight, F35A is 640 kg overweight and F35B is 900 kg overweight. Recently, the United States has invested USD 350 million to improve the anti-fatigue structure of 162 four-generation aircraft. Reducing weight and increasing life are still the main challenges in the manufacturing of military structural parts. 1.2.2 Low cost, rapid manufacturing Rapid manufacturing and low cost manufacturing are warplane industries.

Low cost, rapid manufacturing
Rapid manufacturing and low-cost manufacturing are the core of the industrial production of fighter jets. The existing manufacturing process for structural components has extremely low material utilization, with a material removal rate of over 90% for some structural components; There are many processing procedures and long production cycles for complex structural components. Simplifying manufacturing processes, improving processing efficiency, and improving raw material utilization not only meet the needs of the new situation of national "dual carbon" development, but also meet the fundamental interests of the aviation manufacturing industry.

The development trend of military structural parts manufacturing
Large-scale and integrated structure
At present, the body structure is connected by connectors in a small way [ 3 ], which directly leads to the overweight of the body structure, many fatigue weak links and frequent cracking. For aircraft structural parts, the traditional assembly structure is integrated and manufactured, which not only reduces the number of structural parts and connectors, but also effectively eliminates the separation surface, reduces redundant structures, slows down stress concentration, and reduces fatigue weaknesses. The large-scale and integrated design of the structure breaks through the design limit of the original body, which can reduce the weight of the body structure by more than 20 %, and the mechanical weakness is expected to be reduced by more than 30 %, effectively improving the life of the body. At the same time, the integrated structure simplifies the body assembly tooling and process, and the body manufacturing cycle is expected to be shortened by more than 30 %.

Topologicalization of structural configuration
The bionic topological configuration is used to replace the traditional longitudinal and transverse stiffened plate configuration. The material is arranged according to the force transmission path and functional requirements, and the material can be arranged to the optimal force transmission path to achieve ' no redundancy ' design, further optimize the structural design and achieve weight reduction. Figure 1 shows the aircraft structural parts before and after topology optimization. The weight of the parts is reduced from 0.89 kg to 0.35 kg, and the weight is reduced by 60.6 %.

Integration of structure and function
At present, the structural system and functional system of military aircraft are independent. In the future, the military will integrate the functional system into the structure, cancel the redundancy of the functional system, and integrate the functional structure, such as the integration of thermal protection materials, microstructure and structural configuration, so as to achieve the purpose of heat resistance and heat protection, and further achieve weight loss. The typical heat-resistant and load-bearing integrated structure is shown in Figure 2.

2 Application status of laser processing technology in the manufacturing of titanium alloy aviation structural components
2.1 Laser welding technology
There are two main advantages of laser welding in the manufacture of aviation structural parts [ 4-5 ].Firstly, welding replaces traditional riveting, which saves a lot of rivets and can effectively reduce weight. Secondly, the strength of the whole weld is better than that of multiple rivet connections. As shown in Fig.3, the strength of the titanium alloy weld and its heat affected zone is greater than that of the base metal. The strength of the whole weld is very good, which can effectively increase the fatigue life of the body.

At present, the most widely used and mature is the T-joint double beam Laser beam welding technology, which was first applied by Airbus to the lower fuselage skin welding of A318 series aircraft in 2000 (see Figure 4). It is recognized as a technological revolution in the field of large passenger aircraft manufacturing in the past decade, changing the traditional concept that welding technology is not suitable for aircraft manufacturing. Systematic research has been carried out on laser welding of TC4 titanium alloy and TA15 titanium alloy in China [6-10]. Laser welding has been applied to the manufacturing of titanium alloy web fins, welding of titanium alloy skin, welding of T-joints between wallboard and stringer of some aircraft models in China, and the supporting manufacturing equipment is also relatively mature. Figure 5 shows the dual beam synchronous welding equipment of COMAC, used for the manufacturing of a domestic passenger aircraft. In addition, Beijing Aeronautical Manufacturing Engineering Research Institute has applied laser welding technology to the manufacture of titanium alloy load-bearing components of engines.

The laser welding technology will be further applied to titanium alloy load-bearing structures, especially in situ laser welding of titanium alloys. In situ welding technology belongs to the field of near net forming technology, which refers to the forming technology of mechanical components that require only a small amount of processing or no further processing after the parts are formed. The in-situ welding technology is the first proposed and applied by the United States on F-22 fighter jets. It utilizes high-energy beams to weld the assembly body without the need for secondary mechanical processing after welding, achieving the coordination and unity of the in-situ welding process and assembly technology of aircraft skeleton parts, replacing traditional riveting, greatly reducing weight and shortening the component manufacturing cycle. In the development phase of the F-22, due to the limitations of laser power at that time, a large number of titanium alloy rear fuselage were welded by electron beams. Firstly, 3-4 segments are longitudinally welded to form a box shaped segment, followed by a box mounted segment welded into a frame, and finally welded into an overall cabin segment, as shown in Figure 6. The total length of the titanium alloy weld is about 9 meters, and the mass is reduced by 182 kg compared to the mechanical connection [11]. At present, there is no engineering application of in-situ welding technology in domestic aviation manufacturing field, and the application of in-situ laser welding of titanium alloy structural parts will be a valuable research direction in the future.

In the future, the development trend of laser welding in the field of aviation structural parts manufacturing is to weld more complex body structures and new materials to further reduce body weight and increase life. In addition, the value of aviation structural parts is high, and it is very important to ensure the processing quality. The challenges brought by this mainly include the following aspects :

( 1 ) The accessibility expansion of laser welded joints.

The positioning and clamping tooling of the complex titanium alloy frame structure are interlaced, which greatly interferes with the accessibility of the laser welded joint. On the one hand, it is necessary to reasonably plan the welding path, optimize the tooling design, and maintain the maximum openness of the operating space. On the other hand, it is necessary to carry out the research and development of special welding joints, which have the elements of miniaturization, remote welding, adjustable end pose and so on.

( 2 ) Deformation control.

Deformation control includes welding deformation control and heat treatment deformation control. It is necessary to further carry out the welding process test of the welding object, complete the best welding strategy matching, realize the optimal solution of welding deformation control and ensure the welding reliability. It is necessary to further study the deformation mechanism of heat treatment, and design a reasonable conformal tooling and heat treatment strategy to realize the heat treatment deformation control of complex components. In addition, it is necessary to explore new heat treatment methods, such as ultrasonic impact, laser shock and other special processes to eliminate welding stress.

( 3 ) New material welding.

In view of the demand for temperature resistant materials for future ultra-high speed aircraft, further research on laser welding process of high-temperature titanium alloy and thermoplastic composite materials is needed, and mechanical properties and fatigue properties are assessed to provide support for the subsequent engineering application of new materials.

2.2 Laser additive manufacturing technology
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) and Laser Melting Deposition ( LMD ) are the main laser additive manufacturing processes for titanium alloys [ 12 ]. Aeronautical structural parts have the characteristics of multi-variety and small batch. The more complex the structure is, the more obvious the cost and efficiency advantages of additive manufacturing are compared with traditional manufacturing methods.

SLM technology has a small layer thickness ( 30 ~ 60μm ), which can directly and rapidly form terminal metal products with high dimensional accuracy and good surface quality. It can realize efficient and dense forming of any complex parts, especially suitable for complex parts with complex special-shaped structures that cannot be manufactured by traditional methods.

General Electric Company focuses on additive manufacturing to reduce its engine manufacturing costs, and has completed batch manufacturing of a large number of parts using SLM technology. Figure 7 shows the aero-engine fuel nozzle, which integrates 20 parts into one part for printing, reduces the weight by 25 %, and has realized the batch manufacturing of tens of thousands of parts. In addition, Airbus applies structural optimization based on finite element analysis to the redesign of existing components, and uses SLM technology to achieve significant weight
